<center><h1 id="___sec0">Group theory used in this course </h1></center> <hr>

<p>
We focus on continuous groups, i.e. group elements depend on a number
of continuous parameters. 
We will take the group SO(3) of rotations
\( R \) in three dimensions as an example. Parameters are angles of
rotation, e.g. Euler angles, and we have for instance
\( R(\alpha,\beta,\gamma) \) in SO(3).  A group consists of elements
(think "symmetry operations") that are closed under multiplication
(i.e. multiplying two group elements yields a third), and each have an
inverse.

<p>
Consider a rotation of the vector \( \vec{r}=(x,y,z) \) around the axis
\( \delta\vec{\alpha}=(\delta\alpha_x,\delta\alpha_y,\delta\alpha_z) \),
where \( \delta\alpha_{x,y,z}\ll 1 \) are small angles. Under the rotation
\( \vec{r}\to\vec{r}+\delta\vec{r} \) with
$$
\begin{align}
\delta\vec{r}&=\delta\vec{\alpha}\times\vec{r} \nonumber\\
&=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & -\delta\alpha_z & \delta\alpha_y\\
\delta\alpha_z &  0 & -\delta\alpha_x\\
-\delta\alpha_y &  \delta\alpha_x & 0
\end{array}\right)
\left(\begin{array}{c}
x\\
y\\
z
\end{array}\right) .
\label{_auto1}
\end{align}$$

Writing \( \delta\vec{r} = -i\delta\alpha_x L_x \vec{r}-i\delta\alpha_y
L_y \vec{r}-i\delta\alpha_z L_z \vec{r}  \) yields matrix expressions
for \( L_{x,y,z} \), the generators of rotations around the corresponding
axes.

<p>
For the cases of our interest, each group element can be
written as an exponentiation of generators \( L_j \), i.e.
$$
\begin{align}
R(\alpha_x, \alpha_y, \alpha_z) = e^{-i\left(\alpha_x L_x + \alpha_y L_y + \alpha_z L_z\right)} .
\label{expon}
\end{align}
$$

This generates orthogonal 3x3 matrices. The picture is as follows. The
vector \( (\alpha_x,\alpha_y,\alpha_z) \) is in the direction of the axis
of rotation, and the angle of rotation is its magnitude
\( (\alpha_x^2+\alpha_y^2+\alpha_z^2)^{1/2} \).

<p>
As an example, let us consider rotations around the \( z \) axis by an
angle \( \alpha \). The corresponding rotation matrix in three-dimensonal
space is well known to you:
$$
\begin{align}
R_z(\alpha) = 
\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
\cos\alpha & -\sin\alpha & 0\\
\sin\alpha &  \cos\alpha & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{array}\right) .
\label{_auto2}
\end{align}$$

<p>
The matrix of \( L_z \) is 
$$
L_z=\begin{align}
\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & -i & 0\\
i &  0 & 0\\
0 &  0 & 0
\end{array}\right) , 
\label{_auto3}
\end{align}$$

and we have indeed \( R_z(\alpha) = \exp{(-i\alpha L_z)} \). In
Mathematica, for instance, the function MatrixExp can be used to
verify this.

<p>
If the exponentiation of generators is a novel concept to you,
consider rotations around the \( z \) axis from the following
perspective. Consider a functin \( f(r,\phi) \) in the \( xy \) plane. Here we
used \( x=r\cos\phi \) and \( y=r\sin\phi \).  A rotation of \( f \) by an angle
\( \alpha \) yields \( f(r,\phi-\alpha) \), and the operator that accomplishes
this is
$$
\begin{align}
f(r,\phi-\alpha) &= \sum_{n=0}^\infty {(-\alpha\partial_\phi)^n f\over n!}\bigg\vert_{r,\phi}\nonumber\\
&= \sum_{n=0}^\infty {\left(-i\alpha L_z\right)^n f\over n!}\bigg\vert_{r,\phi}\nonumber\\
&=e^{-i\alpha L_z} f(r,\phi) ,
\label{_auto4}
\end{align}
$$

and \( L_z = -i\partial_\phi \) is the generator. We note that we cannot
simply take \( \partial_\phi \) as a generator, because that operator is
not Hermitian. (To see this, apply it to functions \( e^{im\phi} \) and
compute matrix elements.)

<p>
The generators fulfill commutation relations that define the group,
and we have in general
$$
\begin{align}
[L_k, L_l] = i \sum_m f_{klm}L_m .
\label{_auto5}
\end{align}
$$

Here, \( f_{klm} \) are the group's structure constants, and we have of
course \( f_{klm}=\varepsilon_{klm} \) for SO(3).

<p>
Physicists are interested in finite-dimensional matrix representations
of the group's generators. In the case of SO(3), let us use \( L_{\pm} =
L_x\pm iL_y \), and matrix elements are
$$
\begin{align}
\langle l m'\vert L_\pm \vert l m\rangle &= \sqrt{l(l+1)-m(m\pm 1)} \vert l
m\pm1\rangle , 
\label{_auto6}\\ \langle l m'\vert L_z \vert l m\rangle &= m\vert l
m\rangle .
\label{_auto7}
\end{align}
$$

Thus, for the rotation group SO(3) we know all \( (2l+1) \) dimensional
matrix representations of the generators, and the exponentiation
\eqref{expon} would give us rotation matrices.

<p>
Let us turn to SU(2). This is the special unitary group in two
dimensions, i.e. it transforms two-dimensional vectors in a complex
Hilbert space. This is the group of unitary matrices in two
dimensions, i.e. the group of unitary 2x2 matrices. How many
parameters (i.e. how many generators) does this group have?
Traceless, complex Hermitian 2x2 matrices have three parameters (two
for the complex off-diagonal matrix element plus two real diagonal
marix element minus one condition that the sum of diagonal elements
vanishes). Thus, there are three generators for SU(2), and we can take
Pauli matrices as examples. In the case of isospin, for instance, we
denote the vector of Pauli matrices as
\( \vec{\tau}=(\tau_x,\tau_y,\tau_z) \), and a rotation in isospin space
by &quot;angles&quot; \( \vec{\alpha}=(\alpha_x,\alpha_y,\alpha_z) \) is generated
by the operator \( \exp{(-i\vec{\alpha}\cdot\vec{\tau})} \).

<p>
Finally, we turn to SU(3), the special unitary group in three
dimensions. SU(3) transforms three-dimensional vectors in a complex
Hilbert space. This is the group of unitary matrices in three
dimensions, i.e. the group of unitary 3x3 matrices. How many
parameters (i.e. how many generators) does this group have?
Traceless, complex Hermitian 3x3 matrices have eight parameters (two
for the each of the three complex off-diagonal matrix element plus
three real diagonal marix element minus one condition that the sum of
diagonal elements vanishes). Thus, there are eight generators for
SU(3), and one usually takes the Gell-Mann matrices as examples.

<p>
The bird's eye view: Continous groups are defined by the commutation
relation of their generators. Generators are linear operators, and the
exponentiation of generators induces the symmetry operations.

<p>

<center><h1 id="___sec1">Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) </h1></center> <hr>

<p>
Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong nuclear
interaction.  Here we briefly discuss aspects of QCD that are
essential for this course.

<h1 id="___sec2">QCD Lagrangian </h1>

<p>
QCD describes the interactions between quarks and gluons. The
Lagrangian density is

$$
\begin{align}
\label{QCDLag}
{\cal L}(x) = \sum_{f=u,d,s,c,b,t} \sum_{c c'=r,g,b}\overline{\psi}_{fc}(x)
\left(iD_{cc'} - m_f\delta_{c c'}\right)
\psi_{fc'}(x)
-{1\over 4} \sum_{a=1}^8 F_{\mu\nu}^a(x) F^{a~\mu\nu}(x)
\end{align}
$$

<p>
Here, the sums are over flavors \( f \), colors \( c,c' \), and gluons
\( a \). The quark spinor fields are denoted as \( \psi_{fc}(x) \), the
covariant derivative

$$
\begin{align}
\left[iD\right]_{cc'} =i\delta_{cc'}\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu +{g}\sum_{a=1}^8 A_\mu(x)^a{\lambda^a_{cc'}\over 2}
\label{_auto8}
\end{align}
$$

<p>
couples quarks and gluons, and the field strength tensor is

$$
\begin{align}
F_{\mu\nu}^a(x) \equiv \partial_\mu A_\nu(x) -\partial_\nu A_\mu(x) -g \sum_{b,c=1}^8f^{abc}A_\mu^b(x) A_\nu^c(x) . 
\label{_auto9}
\end{align}
$$

<p>
The strong coupling is denoted as \( g \). The Gell-Mann matrices
\( \lambda^a \), \( a=1,\ldots, 8 \), are the generators of SU(3),
i.e. traceless Hermitian \( 3\times 3 \) matrices.  They play the same
role for SU(3) at the the Pauli matrices do for SU(2), and \( f^{abc} \)
are the gauge group's structure constants, i.e.

$$
\begin{align}
\left[\lambda^a,\lambda^b\right] = i f^{abc}\lambda^c .
\label{_auto10}
\end{align}
$$

Complex Hermitian \( 3\times 3 \) matrices can be built from 9 matrices:
Three matrices with real elements on the diagonal, three with real
elements on the off-diagonal, and three with purely imaginary elements
on the off-diagonal. Generators are traceless, i.e. we have to remove
one of the diagonal matrices. This makes a total of 8 matrices.

We clearly have two light quarks (possibly three if one counts the \( s \)
quark), while the others are heavy. Defining the mass is subtle
because of confinement.

<h1 id="___sec8">Running coupling constant and asymptotic freedom </h1>

<p>
In analogy to quantum electrodynamics (QED), where \( \alpha_{qed}
\equiv e^2/(4\pi) \), we define the strong coupling as \( \alpha_s\equiv
g^2/(4\pi) \). We want to discuss the (resolution) scale dependence of
these coupling constants.

<p>
In electromagnetism, a dielectric medium alters the force between two
charges from
$$
\begin{equation}
F = {q_1 q_2\over 4\pi r^2} \to {q_1 q_2\over 4\pi \varepsilon r^2} , 
\label{_auto13}
\end{equation}
$$

with \( \varepsilon>1 \) because of screening.

The QED vacuum is like a polarizable medium because of quantum
fluctuations. For very short times, electron-positron pairs can be
created as vacuum fluctuations, and such \( e^+ e^- \) pairs also induce
some sort of screening. This makes the QED coupling constant depending
on the distance (or via Fourier transform) on the momentum scale, and
we deal with running coupling constants. In QED, the running of the
coupling strength as the momentum scale \( \mu \) is varied is determined by a
renormalization group (RG) equation
$$
\begin{equation}
\label{RGqed}
\mu {d \over d\mu}\alpha_{qed}(\mu) = \beta_{qed}(\mu) .
\end{equation}
$$

Here, \( \beta_{qed}(\mu) = 2\alpha_{qed}^2/(3\pi) > 0 \) is the &quot;beta
function,&quot; and the solution of the RG equation \eqref{RGqed} yields
$$
\begin{equation}
{1\over\alpha_{qed}(\mu)} = {1\over\alpha_{qed}(\mu_0)} -{1\over 3\pi}\log{\mu^2\over\mu_0^2} . 
\label{_auto14}
\end{equation}
$$

In QED, \( \alpha_{qed}(\mu=0) \approx {1\over 137} \), while
\( \alpha_{qed}(\mu=M_Z) \approx {1\over 128} \) at the mass of the \( Z_0 \)
boson \( (M_Z\approx 91 \) GeV). Thus, in QED, the coupling strength
increases with increasing momentum scale.

<p>
QCD is different. The RG equation for the strong coupling depends on the beta function
$$
\begin{equation}
\beta_{qcd}(\alpha_s) = -{11-{2\over 3} n_f\over 2\pi}\alpha_s^2 +\cdots . 
\label{_auto15}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
Here, \( n_f \) denotes the number of &quot;active&quot; flavors. This
contribution to the beta function stems from quarks and enters with a
positive sign. However, gluon self-interactions yield a negative
contribution, and the beta function is negative overall. As a
consequence
$$
\begin{equation}
{1\over\alpha_{s}(\mu)} = {33-2n_f\over 6\pi} \log{\mu\over \Lambda_{qcd}} , 
\label{_auto16}
\end{equation}
$$

where \( \Lambda_{qcd}\approx 250 \) MeV replaces the integration constant
\( \alpha_s(\mu_0) \). For momenta \( \mu\gg \Lambda_{qcd} \), \( \alpha_s \ll
1 \), and the strong coupling vanishes in the limit of infinite momentum
transfer. This is asymptotic freedom, and QCD becomes perturbative in
this regime.

<p>
On the other hand, for momenta \( \mu\lesssim \Lambda_{qcd} \), the strong
coupling constant becomes large, and QCD becomes a non-perturbative
theory that (so far) can only be solved numerically within lattice
QCD.

<h1 id="___sec9">Confinement </h1>

<p>
No individual quarks have ever been observed. Jets, measured in
high-energy collisions of strongly interacting particles, however, can
be calculated in QCD as originating from individual quarks or gluons
(because the momentum transfers are large), yet the final experimental
signature are hadrons, i.e. color neutral objects with confined
quarks. Figure <a href="#jet">4</a> shows a simulation of a collision that results
(among other things) in a \( \mu^+ \mu^- \) pair and a \( b \overline{b} \)
quark-antiquark pair that hardonizes as it leaves the region where it
was created in the collision.

<p>
Confinement is not really understood. In a potential model, QCD at
large momentum transfers (i.e. at short distances) is based on
single-gluon exchange between quarks. As single photon exchange in QED
yields the Coulomb potential, QCD gives a \( \alpha_s/r \) potential at
short distances. At large distances, however, the potential increases
linearly with increasing distance, see Fig. <a href="#qcd_pot">5</a>. Thus two
quarks can never be separated. Instead, as one starts to separate two
quarks, the ever increasing energy needed to do this creates an
increasing number of quark-antiquark pairs.

<h1 id="___sec10">Isospin symmetry </h1>

<p>
The lightest two quarks have very similar masses, and the mass
difference is small compared to \( \Lambda_{qcd} \). In the constituent
quark model, neutrons \( (n) \) and protons \( (p) \) are states \( \vert
n\rangle = \vert udd\rangle \) and \( \vert p\rangle = \vert uud\rangle \),
respectively, and they also have very similar masses (939.5 and 938.3
MeV, respectively). This led Heisenberg to introduce isospin symmetry
for the proton and neutron, viewing both particles as two states of
the <b>nucleon</b>, i.e. being isospin \( T=1/2 \) states with isospin
projections \( T_z=\pm 1/2 \), respectively.  Thus, \( \vert n\rangle =
\vert T=1/2,T_z=1/2\rangle \), and \( \vert p\rangle = \vert
T=1/2,T_z=-1/2\rangle \), and the strong nuclear force was viewed as
being approximately invariant under SU(2) isospin symmetry, i.e. one
can rotate the proton and neutron states in isospin space. Later, this
(approximate) symmetry of the strong force was also seen in other
hadrons. Note that particle physicists often use \( I \) and \( I_3 \) instead
of \( T \) and \( T_3 \) to refer to isospin and its projection.

<h1 id="___sec13">Spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry </h1>

<p>
Under Lorentz transformations, two-component spinors either transform
as the left-handed \( (L) \) or the right-handed \( (R) \) representation of
the Lorentz group, and we call them left- and right-handed spinors,
respectively. In other words: The Lorentz group has two
two-dimensional representations, one called left-handed and the other
called right-handed. Lagrangians are Lorentz scalars and employ
bilinear forms of spinors. It turns out that one needs four-component
spinors, i.e. spinors consisting of a two-component left-handed and a
two-component right-handed spinor.

<p>
Chirality can be understood without refering to the representations of
symmetry groups only for massless fermions, because it is then similar
to helicity. Helicity is the projection of a particle's spin onto its
momentum. Massless particles have the same helicity in any frame of
reference, and for such particles a projection onto states with
left-handed (right-handed) helicity also projects onto states with
left-handed (right-handed) chirality.

<p>
The lightest quarks, i.e. the \( u \) and \( d \) flavors, are approximately
massless, and in the limit of vanishing masses for these quarks, the
QCD Lagrangian exhibits a \( SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \) chiral
symmetry, i.e. it is invariant under independent SU(2) rotations
between the left-handed doublet \( (u_L,d_L) \) and SU(2) rotations of the
and right-handed doublet \( (u_R,d_R) \), respectively. In practice,
the \( SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \) chiral symmetry implies that hadrons with
identical spin but opposite parities have equal masses, i.e. hadrons
come in parity doublets. As the \( u \) and \( d \) quarks have small masses
(and are also slightly different in mass), we expect that this
degeneracy of parity doublets is only approximately realized in
nature.

<p>
Let us see, to what extent this symmetry is realized in nature.  The
nucleon is the lightest \( J^\pi={1\over 2}^+ \) state, but the nearest
\( J^\pi={1\over 2}^- \) state is 600 MeV higher in energy. Clearly, the
\( SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \) chiral symmetry is not realized in nature, at
least not at low energies.

<p>
How to solve this puzzle? The spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry
addresses this question. We will digress into spontaneous symmetry
breaking in general and then come back to the spontaneous breaking of
chiral symmetry.

<h1 id="___sec14">Spontaneous symmetry breaking </h1>

<h2 id="___sec15">Why does SSB exist? </h2>

<p>
The laws of nature are invariant under rotations. How can deformed
object exist (after ground states with angular momentum \( l=0 \) are
spherically symmetric)? The laws of nature are invariant under
translations. How can it be that objects are localized in space (after
all, plane waves have a uniform probability density in space)? The key
to answer these (and related) questions is spontaneous symmetry
breaking (SSB).

<p>
Let us consider the rotations of a rigid body (with moment of inertia
\( \Theta \)). The energy spectrum is

$$
\begin{equation}
E = {\hbar^2 L(L+1)\over 2\Theta}
\label{_auto17}

Given an estimate for a macroscopic object for the level
spacing near the ground state! How does \( \Theta \) depend on the number
of partciles \( N \) for a liquid or solid?

<h2><div id="___sec17"></div></h2>
</div>


<p>
Let us consider the case of the rotor in the presence of a small
perturbation \( \varepsilon \) that breaks rotational invariance. It is
interesting to consider the limits

$$
\begin{align}
\lim_{N\to\infty}\lim_{\varepsilon\to 0} & 
\label{_auto18}\\
\quad\mbox{and} & \nonumber\\
\lim_{\varepsilon\to 0}\lim_{N\to\infty} &
\label{_auto19}
\end{align}
$$

<p>
separately.  In the first case, the perturbation acts on a finite
rotor. As long as \( \varepsilon \) is larger than the level spacing, the
ground state will be deformed, i.e. a superposition of states with
different \( L \) quantum numbers. Once \( \varepsilon \) is much smaller than
the level spacing, the ground state is spherically symmetric, and it
will remain spherically symmetric as the particle number is increased.
In the second case, the ground state will be deformed for arbitrarily
small perturbations \( \varepsilon \), because the level spacing becomes
zero as \( N\to\infty \), and removing the perturbation will leave us with
a deformed ground state. For a macroscopic object \( \Theta\to\infty \),
and states with different angular momentum become degenerate.

<p>
We see that the order of taking the limits is important. (Do you know
other examples in physics where this is the case?) Similar though
experiments can be performed for the center-of-mass motion of an
object with mass \( M \), as the kinetic energy \( p^2/(2M) \) tends to zero
for \( M\to\infty \), i.e. for infinite particle number, and
superpositions of different plane wave states can make a localized
center-of-mass wave function.

<p>
Thus, SSB happens in a <b>macroscopic</b> system \( (N\to\infty \) is
strictly required) when an arbitrarily small symmetry breaking
perturbation leads to a ground states with lower symmetry than the
Hamiltonian.

<h2 id="___sec18">Inequivalent Hilbert spaces </h2>

<p>
Let us consider a simple model for a solid in one dimension. This is a
crystal with lattice spacing \( a \). Let \( \psi(x) \) describe the wave
function of a single ion. We assume that \( \psi(x) \) and \( \psi(x-a) \) are
orthogonal to each other. Take an ion in a box of size \( a \), or a DVR
basis as examples.  The ground-state for \( 2N+1 \) ions is thus

$$
\begin{equation}
\label{gs}
\Psi(x_{-N}, x_{-N+1},\ldots,x_N)
  = \prod_{j=-N}^{N} \psi(x_j-ja) .
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
Of course, the wave function needs to be symmetrized or
anti-symmetrized, depending on the spin of the ions, but this is not
an essential point here. Let us consider a translation of the crystal
by \( \eta \). The operator that accomplishes this is

$$
\begin{equation}
\hat{U}(\eta) = e^{-i\eta \hat{P}}
\label{_auto20}
\end{equation}
$$

with the total momentum
$$
\begin{equation} \hat{P} = \sum_{j=-N}^N
-i{\partial\over\partial x_j}
\label{_auto21}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
as the generator. We
get the translated wave function

$$
\begin{equation}
\hat{U}(\eta)
\Psi(x_{-N}, x_{-N+1},\ldots,x_N) = \Psi(x_{-N}-\eta,
x_{-N+1}-\eta,\ldots,x_N-\eta)
\label{_auto22}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
as the result.

<p>
We note that the energy of the translated wave function is the same as
the energy of the original wave function. We also note that the
translated wave function is orthogonal to the original wave function:
The overlap of the translated wave function with the original wave
function&nbsp;\eqref{gs} is

$$
\begin{align}
\langle \Psi|\hat{U}(\eta)|\Psi\rangle &=
\prod_{j=-N}^N \int\limits_{-\infty}^\infty{\rm d}x_j \psi^*(x_j) \psi(x_j-\eta) \nonumber\\
  &= \left(\int\limits_{-\infty}^\infty {\rm d}x \psi^*(x) \psi(x-\eta)\right)^{2N+1} \nonumber \\
  &= |I|^{2N+1},
\label{overlap}
  \end{align}
$$

<p>
where \( I \) with \( |I| < 1 \) is the value of the integral between the
translated and original wave function \( \psi \). For \( N\to\infty \), the
overlap \eqref{overlap} between the translated and original crystal
thus vanishes for any arbitrarily small displacement \( \eta \).  Does
this mean that the ground state has infinite degeneracy? This problem
can only be avoided by the insight that the Hilbert spaces of two
crystals with different positions of the center of mass are unitarily
inequivalent, i.e.  one has a different Hilbert space for each
position of the center of mass. As a translation yields a state
outside the Hilbert space, it is not an allowed dynamical excitation
of the ground state.

<p>
Again, we see that this can only happen in an infinite system. In a
finte system, ground states that differ by a (small) symmetry
operation have a finite overlap and cannot be orthogonal to each
other. Thus, they reside in the same Hilbert space. Superpositions of
such states (that individally break the symmetry) then yield an
eigenstate of the symmetry operation and thus exhibit the correct
symmetry. Projection techniques yield such states, and (up to a
normalization) as

$$
\begin{equation}
\int {\rm d}\eta \hat{U}(\eta)\Psi(x_{-N},\ldots,x_N)
\label{_auto23}
\end{equation}
$$

indeed gives a state that is invariant under symmetry transformation
\( \hat{U} \) when the integral is over the group parameters (i.e. over
all displacements for translational invariance or over all rotations
angles for rotational invariance, respectively).  We thus saw that
translations (rotations) are not excitations of systems with SSB of
translational (rotational) symmetry. Next we want to understand what
are the relevant low-energy excitations for systems exhibiting SSB.

<h2 id="___sec19">Low-energy excitations in presence of SSB: Nambu-Goldstone bosons </h2>

<p>
Let us return to the example of an infinite crystal in one dimension
and the spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry. The ions are
at positions \( x_j=ja \), \( j \) being an integer and \( a \) the lattice
spacing. Let us turn to the continuum limit and instead consider an
ion at a continous position label \( x \). This yields a field theory, and
the continuum limit is useful for the description of physical
phenomena with momenta \( k\ll 1/a \). Consider the operation

$$
\begin{equation}
\label{Utrans}
\hat{U}(\eta) = e^{-i \eta(t,x)\hat{P}} ,
\end{equation}
$$

where the momentum operator
$$
\begin{equation}
\hat{P}=-i{\partial \over\partial x}
\label{_auto24}
\end{equation}
$$

generates translations. Let us understand the action of the
operation \eqref{Utrans} on the ground state \( \Psi \). An ion at position
\( x \) is displaced by an amount \( \eta(t,x) \) at time \( t \). A snapshot (at fixed time \( t \) and for a
two-dimensional crystal, where \( \vec{\eta}(t, \vec{x}) \) is the
displacement vector of the ion at position \( \vec{x} \)) is shown in
Fig. <a href="#fig1">6</a>.

<p>
We note that this state, characterized by the function \( \eta(t,x) \) has
again zero overlap with the ground state, using essentially the same
argument as above. Thus, the state \( \hat{U}(\eta(t,x)) \Psi \) is a true
excitation of the ground state \( \Psi \).

<p>
What is the energy of such an excitation? For long wavelengths
\( \lambda \gg a \) (implying small displacements \( |\eta(t,x)|\sim
a^2/\lambda \ll a \)) restoring forces will be harmonic, and the energy
is thus proportional to the momentum squared, i.e. the square of the
inverse wave length, or the squared displacement (again proportional
to \( \lambda^{-2} \)). As for an infinite system the wavelength can be
arbitrarily large, excitation energies can be arbitrarily small. This
implies that excitation energies can be arbitrarily small. The low
energy excitations in presence of SSB are (mass less) Nambu-Goldstone
(NG) bosons.

<h2 id="___sec20">Construction of  Lagrangians in the presence of SSB </h2>

<p>
We want to construct Lagrangians that describe the low-lying excitations
in presence of SSB, i.e. the Lagrangian that governs the dynamics of NG fields. The technique here is {\it effective field theory} (EFT). The construction of EFTs follows a recipe

<ul>
<li> Identify the relevant degrees of freedom at the scale of interest.</li>
<li> Write down all terms consistent with the symmetry of the microscopic Hamiltonian and the SSB.</li>
<li> Determine the power counting and order terms regarding their size.</li>
</ul>

We already know:

<ul>
<li> Identify the relevant degrees of freedom at the scale of interest:} In the presence of SSB, Nambu-Goldstone fields are the relevant degrees of freedom.</li>
</ul>

As NG fields can have arbitrarily low energies, only derivative couplings are
allowed. Let us consider SSB of translations again as an example. The action of the
translation operator onto a lattice ion at \( x_0 \) is
$$
\begin{equation}
\label{transl}
e^{i\eta\hat{P}} x_0 = x_0+\eta .
\end{equation}
$$

Derivatives of NG fields are the key ingredients of that enter any Lagrangian.
Let \( \partial_t = \partial/(\partial t) \) and \( \partial_x/(\partial x) \) be shorthands for
partial derivatives. We have (\( j=t, x \))
$$
\begin{equation}
\partial_j e^{i\eta\hat{P}} x_0 = \partial_j\eta .
\label{_auto25}
\end{equation}
$$

The Lagrangian governing the crystal is invariant under translations, parity, and time reversal.

<ul>
<li> Write down all terms consistent with the symmetry of the microscopic Hamiltonian and the SSB:} The Lagrangian governing the crystal is invariant under translations, parity, and time reversal.</li>
</ul>

Under parity \( \hat{\Pi} \) we have
$$
\begin{align}
\hat{\Pi}^{-1}  \left( e^{i\eta\hat{P}} x_0 \right) \hat{\Pi} &= e^{-\hat{\Pi}^{-1}\eta\hat{\Pi} (-\hat{P})} (-x_0) \nonumber \\
&= -x_0 - \hat{\Pi}^{-1}\eta\hat{\Pi} .
\label{parity}
\end{align}
$$

Considering the right-hand side of Eq.&nbsp;\eqref{transl} under parity,
and comparing with Eq.&nbsp;\eqref{parity} thus yields
$$
\begin{equation}
\hat{\Pi}^{-1}\eta\hat{\Pi} = \eta .
\label{_auto26}
\end{equation}
$$

Thus the NG field is even under parity. Similarly, one finds that
\( \eta \) is even under time reversal.  As a scalar field, \( \eta \) is
invariant under translations. There are thus infinitely many
combinations of fields and derivatives that we can write down. The
power counting is an organizational scheme that allows us to order
terms by there contributions to the energy. We are interested in low
energies of scale \( \omega \), i.e. NG fields are waves with frequency
\( \omega \) and wave length \( \lambda\propto \omega^{-1} \). Let \( \Lambda \)
be the (momentum or energy) scale where the low-energy theory breaks
down. For a crystal with lattice spacing \( a \), the whole picture of a
continuous wave breaks down at \( \Lambda\sim a^{-1} \). Thus we have

$$
\begin{align}
\partial_t &\sim \omega , \nonumber\\
\partial_x &\sim \lambda^{-1}\sim\omega , \nonumber\\
\eta &\sim {a^2\over\lambda} \sim a {\omega\over\Lambda} \sim {\omega\over\Lambda^2}\ .
\label{power}
\end{align}
$$

We are (only) interested in the regime \( \omega \ll \Lambda \).  We note
that terms such as \( \eta \) or \( \eta^2 \) cannot enter the Lagrangian
because \( \eta \) is a massless NG field. We also note that terms with a
single derivative cannot enter because they violate parity or time
reversal symmetry. Thus the simplest Lagrangian we can write down is
$$
\begin{equation}
\label{phonon}
{\cal L} = {\rho_0\over 2}\left({\partial \eta\over\partial t}\right)^2
-{\mu\over 2} \left({\partial \eta\over\partial x}\right)^2 .
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
Here, \( \rho_0 \) is the mass density and \( \mu \) the compression
module. They must be determined from data (or computed from a more
microscopic theory) and are low-energy coefficients (LECs) in an EFT.
Recall that a Lagrangian density \( {\cal L} \) has units length \( ^{-d-1} \)
in \( d \) spatial dimensions (because \( \int dt d^dx {\cal L} \) is an
action and thus proportional to \( \hbar \), i.e. of dimension length \( ^0 \)
(as we use units with \( \hbar=c=1 \) ). Thus,
$$
\begin{equation}
\rho_0\sim {\Lambda^4\over\omega^2}\quad\mbox{and}\quad \mu\sim
{\Lambda^4\over\omega^2}
\label{_auto27}
\end{equation}
$$

yield Lagrangian densities
that scale as \( {\cal L}\sim \omega^2 \), i.e. the Lagrangian \( \int dx
{\cal L} \sim \omega^{-1}{\cal L} \) is of the low energy scale
\( \omega \). If there were no other physics scales, we would be done. The
Lagrangian density&nbsp;\eqref{phonon} describes waves (see below), and all
restoring forces are harmonic. Corrections to this picture are due to
physics at the breakdown scale (rupture of the crystal for large
energies \( \Lambda \), or electronic excitations at a scale \( \Lambda_e \)
with \( \omega \ll \Lambda_e \). We will not distinguish between the scale
where new degrees of freedom enter (i.e. \( \Lambda_e \) ) and the scale
\( \Lambda \) where the crystal breaks. At the breakdown scale 
$$
\begin{align}
\partial_x &\sim \partial_x\sim\Lambda , \nonumber \\
\eta&\sim \Lambda^{-1} .
\label{_auto28}
\end{align}
$$

<p>
Thus, the leading-order terms
contribute
$$
\begin{equation} \rho_0(\partial_t\eta)^2 \sim \rho_0
\Lambda^2 \Lambda^{-2} \sim \rho_0 \sim {\Lambda^4\over\omega^2}
\label{_auto29}
\end{equation}
$$

Consider now a correction term \( g \partial^k \eta^l \)
with an LEC \( g \), \( k \) derivatives, and \( l \) fields. This term is due to
physics at the breakdown scale that can be reached via virtual
excitations. At the breakdown scale, this term must be as important as
the leading-order terms of the Lagrangian&nbsp;\eqref{phonon}. Thus,
$$
\begin{align}
g\Lambda^k\Lambda^{-l} \sim \rho_0 \Lambda^2
\Lambda^{-2} =\rho_0
\label{_auto30}
\end{align}
$$

implying
$$
\begin{equation}
g\sim
\rho_0\Lambda^{l-k} \sim {\Lambda^{4+l-k}\over\omega^2} .
\label{_auto31}
\end{equation}
$$

Thus, at the low-energy scale where the
relations \eqref{power} hold, we have
$$
\begin{equation}
g\partial^k
\eta^l \sim g\omega^k \left({\omega\over\Lambda}\right)^l \sim
\omega^2\left(\omega\over \Lambda\right)^{k+l-4} ,
\label{_auto32}
\end{equation}
$$

and these are indeed corrections to the leading-order terms.

<ul>
<li> Determine the power</li>
</ul>

counting and order terms regarding their size: A term with \( k \)
derivatives and \( l \) fields is suppressed by \( (\omega/\Lambda)^{k+l-4} \)
compared to the leading-order contributions.

<p>
These steps can be employed for any physics situation with a
separation of scales \( \omega \ll \Lambda \).

<p>
Let us finally solve the Lagrangian density&nbsp;\eqref{phonon}.
The Euler-Lagrange equations (\( \partial_t \equiv {\partial\over\partial t} \)
and \( \partial_x \equiv {\partial\over\partial x} \))
$$
\begin{equation}
   {\partial_t} {\partial {\cal L}\over \partial(\partial_t\eta)}
      +{\partial_x} {\partial {\cal L}\over \partial(\partial_x\eta)}
         -{\partial {\cal L}\over \partial\eta} = 0
\label{_auto33}
\end{equation}
$$

for the Lagrangian density&nbsp;\eqref{phonon} yield the equations of motion
$$
\begin{equation}
	 \rho_0 \partial_t^2 \eta - \mu\partial_x^2\eta = 0 .
\label{_auto34}
\end{equation}
$$

Solutions are plane waves

\label{dispersion}
\omega = \sqrt{\mu\over\rho_0} |k| .
\end{equation}
$$

Here \( \sqrt{\mu/\rho_0} \) is the the velocity of sound. Thus, an EFT
based on symmetry arguments alone yields the dispersion
relation&nbsp;\eqref{dispersion} that governs (acoustic) phonons in
solids. We have also devised a way to systematically improve the
theory.  What is the next-to-leading order correction?

<h2 id="___sec21">Spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry </h2>

<p>
Let us return to QCD. We know that axial vector symmetry \( SU(2)_{L-R} \)
is spontaneously broken by the QCD vacuum. Let us compare this case
with the crystal discussed above.

<p>
Note, that \( F_\pi\approx 92.4 \)&nbsp;MeV is the pion decay constant. Thus,
pion fields are in units of MeV.  The QCD vacuum breaks chiral
symmetry, i.e. the expectation value
$$
\begin{equation}
\langle\overline{q} q\rangle \ne 0 .
\label{_auto36}
\end{equation}
$$

Recall that the quark field \( q=q_L+q_r \), and thus the scalar density
$$
\begin{equation}
 \overline{q} q =  \overline{q}_L q_R + \overline{q}_R q_L
\label{_auto37}
\end{equation}
$$

clearly breaks chiral symmetry as it mixes left and right-handed
quarks. Calculations reveal that \( \langle\overline{q}q\rangle\approx  \) (230 MeV) \( ^3 \).

<p>
Let us write
$$
\begin{align}
\hat{U} \equiv e^{{i\over F_\pi}\left(\pi_0\tau_0 +\pi_-\tau_++\pi_+\tau_-\over f_\pi\right)}
= e^{{i\over F_\pi}
\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\pi_0 & \sqrt{2}\pi_+\\
\sqrt{2}\pi_- & -\pi_0
\end{array} \right)}.
\label{_auto38}
\end{align}$$

The leading-order term of the pion Lagrangian density is
$$
\begin{equation}
\label{pions}
{\cal L} = {F_\pi^2\over 4} {\rm Tr}\left(\partial_\mu \hat{U} \partial^\mu\hat{U}^\dagger\right)  .
\end{equation}
$$

Why is there only one LEC here compared with two LECs for the phonon
Lagrangian density&nbsp;\eqref{phonon}? Check the dimensions of the
Lagrangian density&nbsp;\eqref{pions}.  Note that the EFT involving pions
can now be extended to couple nucleons and pions in a systematic way.

<p>
Explicit symmetry breaking: The \( u \) and \( d \) quarks have non-zero
masses \( m_u \) and \( m_d \), respectively.  Introducing the mass matrix
$$
\begin{align}
\hat{M}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
m_u & 0\\
0 & m_d \end{array}\right)
\label{_auto39}
\end{align}$$

we can add the term proportional to
$$
\begin{equation}
- {\rm Tr} \left(\hat{M}\hat{U}^\dagger + \hat{U}\hat{M}\right)
\label{_auto40}
\end{equation}
$$

to the Lagrangian&nbsp;\eqref{pions}. This term explicitly breaks chiral symmetry.
